## Description

You have been assigned with designing and developing a form component for a Forms product. Your solution should meet the following requirements:

- The program needs to run in the terminal.
- The user should have the ability to:
    - Import a form from a file that contains questions for the user to answer. 
    - Fill in a form and print the filled form results to the terminal or a file.
-   The form should be in either JSON or YAML format. You need to define the structure of the form, and the program should only work with properly structured forms.
-   Handle errors gracefully and include a short readme that explains how to run the program.
